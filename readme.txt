Theme to run wordpress headless and provide setup data for an APP connecting to the WordPress API.

== Description ==
This makes the WordPress frontend completely headless: All output will be running via the WordPress API. You can setup
connection for your app here, output a redirect screen etc. This theme features a custom api endpoint for setup data, it will
also create a settings.json if you want to use my connect library for your app.

Also you can setup menus, additional css, fonts etc for the Gutenberg Editor and the frontend stopper page if needed and more.
